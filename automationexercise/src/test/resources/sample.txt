Dear Customer Support,

I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to express my deep disappointment with a recent purchase from your online store.
I ordered a Leather Bag expecting a premium quality item, but upon receiving it, I noticed poor leather quality.
The Bag's leather is making it difficult for me to use the product effectively.

I have been a loyal customer for several years, and this experience falls far below the high
standard of products and services I have come to expect from your brand.
I kindly request a replacement for a purchased product or a full refund of the purchase price.
Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Disha Patel
